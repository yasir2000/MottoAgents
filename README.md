MottoAgents is an experimental open-source application for an Automatic Agents Generation Experiment based on LLM. This program, driven by LLM, autonomously generates multi-agents to achieve whatever goal by intents you set.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Intents**:  represent the agent's deliberative state and define what the agent has chosen to pursue actively. Intentions are desires that the agent has committed to acting upon, indicating both a decision to pursue certain goals and a plan to realize them. They play a vital role in practical reasoning, as they constrain the agent's future actions and guide its behavior towards achieving specific outcomes.
- **Planner**: Determines the expert roles to be added and the specific execution plan according to the problem.
- **Tools**: The set of tools that can be used, currently only compatible with the search tools.
- **Observers**: Responsible for reflecting on whether the planner and the results in the execution process are reasonable, currently including reflection checks on Agents, Plan, and Action.
- **Agents**: Expert role agents generated by the planner, including name, expertise, tools used, and LLM enhancement.
- **Plan**: The execution plan is composed of the generated expert roles, each step of the execution plan has at least one expert role agent.
- **Actions**: The specific actions of the expert roles in the execution plan, such as calling tools or outputting results.

## Installation and Usage

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yasir2000/mottoagents
cd mottoagents
python setup.py install
```

### Configuration

- Configure your API keys and model settings in any of `config/key.yaml / config/config.yaml / env`
- Priority order: `config/key.yaml > config/config.yaml > env`

```bash
# Copy the configuration file and make the necessary modifications.
cp config/config.yaml config/key.yaml
```

| Variable Name | config/key.yaml | env |
| ------------ | --------------- | --- |
| OPENAI_API_KEY # Replace with your own key | OPENAI_API_KEY: "sk-..." | export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..." |
| OPENAI_API_BASE # Optional | OPENAI_API_BASE: "https://<YOUR_SITE>/v1" | export OPENAI_API_BASE="https://<YOUR_SITE>/v1" |
| MODEL_TYPE # Choose model type | MODEL_TYPE: "ollama" | export MODEL_TYPE="ollama" |
| OLLAMA_HOST # Ollama server address | OLLAMA_HOST: "http://localhost:11434" | export OLLAMA_HOST="http://localhost:11434" |
| OLLAMA_MODEL # Ollama model name | OLLAMA_MODEL: "llama2" | export OLLAMA_MODEL="llama2" |

### Usage

#### Using OpenAI Models
```python
python main.py --mode commandline --llm_api_key YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY --serpapi_key YOUR_SERPAPI_KEY --idea "Is LK-99 really a room temperature superconducting material?"
```

#### Using Ollama Local Models
1. First, install and start Ollama server following instructions at [Ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. Pull your desired model:
```bash
ollama pull llama2  # or codellama, mistral, etc.
```
3. Run MottoAgents with Ollama:
```python
python main.py --mode commandline --model_type ollama --ollama_model llama2 --idea "Is LK-99 really a room temperature superconducting material?"
```

#### Websocket Service Mode
```python
python main.py --mode service --host "127.0.0.1" --port 9000
```
